Blundells Cottage is the one of the few remaining cottages from that time period. In addition to the provision of lodgings, the Campbells granted workers a free half day on Saturdays to tend their gardens. Subsequent families also grew their own food for themselves and for sale. This garden bed represents the approximate site of Alice Oldfield's garden. In the 1950s, the Sainsbury family grew potatoes and watermelons on the western side of the house.</p>",

He built Duntroon House on his large Duntroon Estate in 1830, the first limestone dwelling in the region. By 1860, George Campbell, Robert's son, and his wife Marrianne Campbell had moved into Duntroon House. They started a major building program on the estate which included workman's cottages for the newly arrived immigrant workers from Britain. Blundells Cottage was made from stone quarried from Black Mountain and Mount Ainslie and was based upon crofters cottages of Western Scotland.</p>",

William was employed by the Duntroon Estate as the head ploughman and Mary, unlike other wives of workers on the Duntroon Estate, was not employed outside her home. These two rooms are part of the original four-roomed cottage completed in 1860. Can you find what kind of light source the Ginn family may have used in the room before electricity? How did they store their food? How would the Ginn family have mended their clothes? Look out for these kinds of items in the other rooms too, as we travel through time and explore the lives of the families who occupied this Cottage for over 100 years.</p>",

Glenn worked as a carpenter on government constructions in Canberra. These rooms were originally added to the Cottage in the late 1880s to house the Blundell's growing family. What did the Sainsbury family do for fun without television? 100 years has passed since the Ginn family lived in the Cottage. How have things stayed the same? How have they changed?</p>",

Imagine the change in the landscape she would have experienced as she rode her horse, during her decades in the Cottage.</p>",
