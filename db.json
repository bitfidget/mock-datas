Blundells Cottage is the only remaining workers' cottage from that time period. In addition to the provision of lodgings, the Campbells granted workers a free half day on Saturdays to tend their gardens. Subsequent families also grew their own food for themselves and for sale. This garden bed represents the approximate site of Alice Oldfield's garden. The Sainsbury Family (in the 60s) grew potatoes and watermelons on the western side of the house.</p>",

By 1860, George Campbell, Robert's son, and his wife Marrianne Campbell had moved into Duntroon House. They started a major building program on the estate which included workman's cottages for the newly arrived immigrant workers from Britain. Blundells Cottage was made from stone quarried from Black Mountain and Mount Ainslie and was based upon crofters cottages of Western Scotland.</p>",

He built Duntroon House on his large Duntroon Estate in 1830, the first limestone cottage in the region. By 1860, George Campbell, Robert's son, and his wife Marrianne Campbell had moved into Duntroon House. They started a major building program on the estate which included workman's cottages for the newly arrived immigrant workers from Britain. Blundells Cottage was made from stone quarried from Black Mountain and Mount Ainslie and was based upon crofters cottages of Western Scotland.</p>",

The Blundell family lived in the Cottage before and after Canberra was chosen as Australia's Federal Capital. Imagine the development of the city they would have seen during their decades in the Cottage.</p>",
