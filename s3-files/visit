Ginn worked as the head ploughman of the estate, which was run in accordance with Scottish farming practices, allowing workers a house and a small portion of land, in exchange for labour.</p>\n\n<p>The second residents, newlyweds George and Flora Blundell and their children, occupied the cottage from 1874 until George died in December 1933. In 1888, the Blundells extended the southern section of the cottage and added the slab shed to accommodate their growing family. If you look carefully from the west, you can compare the stonework, which is not quite as refined as the original dwelling. The cottage’s name recognises their long occupation of the place.</p>\n\n<p>Part of a working farm, the cottage was surrounded by outbuildings, farm equipment, haystacks, animals and paddocks, and overlooked the Molonglo River (now Lake Burley Griffin). When this area was chosen for the National Capital of Australia in 1913, it marked the the beginning of the end of the pastoral era for the cottage and Duntroon Estate. However, some crops were still grown on the river flats until 1960, and a dairy herd grazed on the eastern paddock until 1962.</p>\n\n<p>The third and last long-term residents were Harry and Alice Oldfield. When Harry died in 1942, Alice let her vacant rooms to boarders for extra income until her own death in 1958.</p>\n\n<p>In 1964, the Canberra and District Historical Society became the custodians of the place and operated it as a house museum. Management of the Cottage was returned to the Commonwealth, the National Capital Authority, in 1999.</p>\n\n\n  <h2>Opening times</h2>\n  <p>For the latest opening hours, please visit <a href=\"https://www.nca.gov.au/blundells\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nca.gov.au/blundells</a></p>\n\n  <h2>Location</h2>\n  <p>Blundells Cottage, Wendouree Drive, Parkes, ACT 2600</p>\n\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Blundells+Cottage/@-35.2928439,149.1395385,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b164d0ce7f9e5f3:0xb97f3e6ba5ba1b81!8m2!3d-35.2928483!4d149.1417325\" target=\"_blank\">View on Google Maps</a></p>\n\n  <h2>Contact</h2>\n\n  <p>Phone: 02 6272 2902\n  <br>Email: <a href=\"mailto:nce@nca.gov.au\">nce@nca.gov.au</a>\n  <br>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NCA.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">nca.gov</a>\n  <br>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nca_media\" target=\"_blank\">@nca_media</a>\n  <br>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nca_gov_au/\" target=\"_blank\">nca_gov_au</a>\n  <br>Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChhbRYkJoFNub6RBlO3X6ZA\" target=\"_blank\">National Capital Authority</a></p>\n\n  <h2>Bookings</h2>\n  <p>Bookings can be made at: <a href=\"https://www.nca.gov.au/discover-and-learn/book-program\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nca.gov.au/discover-and-learn/book-program</a></p>\n\n  <h2>Education</h2>\n  <p>Education kits, linked to the National Curriculum, are available for all ages at: <a href=\"https://www.nca.gov.au/discover-and-learn/education-resources\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nca.gov.au/discover-and-learn/education-resources</a></p>\n  <p><i>Header image: The front of Blundells Cottage.
