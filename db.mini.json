    "text": "<p>Blundell's Farmhouse, Slab Outbuilding and Surrounds was entered on the Commonwealth Heritage List in 2005 (Place ID 105734). The official values of the place include:</p>\n\n<h2>Criterion A: Events and Processes</h2>\n\n<p>The cottage, with internal layout and features, represents the way of life of a 19th century tenant farmer on the Duntroon estate. The residence was built for a station hand as part of the vast Duntroon estate, and was constructed during the extensive building program that was instigated by George and Marianne Campbell in the 1860s in a period of prosperity. Along with Duntroon House and gardens, Duntroon Dairy, Duntroon Woolshed, St Johns Church Precinct, Mugga Mugga Homestead, and Majura Homestead, the cottage precinct is a significant component of the large pre-Canberra pastoral property now extant as an array of features scattered throughout central Canberra.</p>\n\n<p>The attributes are the entire cottage precinct, comprised of the six room farmhouse and slab outbuilding in their landscaped setting.</p>\n\n<h2>Criterion B: Rarity</h2>\n\n<p>The c1860 Blundell's Farmhouse, Slab Outbuilding and Surrounds remain today as a rare survivor of pastoral activities on the Limestone Plains. The cottage precinct demonstrates, along with other remnant nineteenth century sites in the district, the pastoral and agricultural settlement of the Limestone Plains area. The rubble stone farm building is notable as an example of this group, surviving in situ, surrounded by the well-developed Parliamentary Triangle.</p>\n\n<p>The attributes are the same as criterion (a).</p>\n\n<h2>Criterion D: Characteristic Values</h2>\n\n<p>Blundell's Farmhouse, Slab Outbuilding and Surrounds, together with other remnant pastoral and agricultural sites within the ACT demonstrate as a group the well developed structure of European settlement of the Limestone Plains prior to the establishment of the Federal Capital. The precinct provides evidence of a distinctive way of life of early settlers in the district who, with their families, worked as tenant farmers on the Duntroon Estate owned by the Campbells.</p>\n\n<p>The attributes are the same as criterion (a).</p>\n\n  <h2>Criterion E: Aesthetic Characteristics</h2>\n\n<p>The cottage precinct is valued for the aesthetic qualities characterised by the irregular and vernacular charm of the buildings in their parkland setting near the edge of Lake Walter Burley Griffin. The modest nineteenth century cottage site and the surrounding landscape contrast with their developed Parliamentary zone backdrop.</p>\n\n<p>The attributes are the same as criterion (a).</p>\n\n<h2>Criterion H: Significant People</h2>\n\n<p>Blundell’s Cottage precinct shows evidence of the major historical phase in Canberra’s development from the mid nineteenth century to the present. It has clear associations with the Campbells. Robert Campbell being the first white settler to establish a large station on the Limestone Plains. It also has strong associations with the pioneer families who helped to establish the rural settlement of the Limestone Plains, including the Ginns, Blundells and Oldfields.</p>\n\n<p>The attributes are the same as criterion (a).</p>\n\n<h2>Summary Statement of Significance</h2>\n\n<p>Blundell’s Farmhouse, Slab Outbuilding and Surrounds demonstrate the intricate and well-developed fabric of the pre-Federal Capital Limestone Plains. Along with Duntroon House and Gardens, Duntroon Dairy, Duntroon Woolshed, St Johns Church Precinct, Mugga Mugga Homestead, and Majura Homestead, the cottage and its precinct is a significant component of the large pre-Canberra pastoral property now extant as an array of features scattered throughout central Canberra.</p>\n\n<p>The cottage is significant as an agricultural workers dwelling, which provides evidence of a distinctive way of life of early settlers in the Limestone Plains district. It has clear associations with the Campbells and the pioneer Plains families, including the Ginns, Blundells and Oldfields.</p>\n\n<p>Blundell’s Farmhouse, Slab Outbuilding and Surrounds show evidence of the major historical phase of the Limestone Plains development from the mid nineteenth century to the present. The cottage precinct has survived from the early settlement of the district through the establishment and growth of the Federal Capital and now occupies a key position in the Parliamentary Triangle.</p>\n\n<p>Blundell’s Farmhouse, Slab Outbuilding and Surrounds also provides a significant educational resource for the study of social history, landscape history and building and construction material history. The cottage precinct is known regionally and nationally for its educational value, particularly in explaining nineteenth century lifestyle and functions in the family dwelling of a tenant farmer.</p>\n\n<p>The aesthetic significance of the cottage precinct lies in the irregular and vernacular charm of its buildings and landscape.</p>\n\n<h2>Blundells Cottage Heritage Management Plan, GML Heritage 2014</h2>\n\n<p>Under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), all Commonwealth agencies are required to prepare management plans for Commonwealth Heritage listed places under their management. The purpose of a management plan is to identify, protect and manage the heritage values of Blundells Cottage and its surrounds.

When his ship <i>The Sydney</i> was wrecked, he was compensated in the form of rich, grazing land on the Limestone Plains, now Canberra. He built Duntroon House on his large Duntroon Estate in 1830, the first limestone dwelling in the region. By 1860, George Campbell, Robert's son, and his wife Marrianne Campbell had moved into Duntroon House. They started a major building program on the estate which included workman's cottages for the newly arrived immigrant workers from Britain. Blundells Cottage was made from stone quarried from Black Mountain and Mount Ainslie and was based upon crofters cottages of Western Scotland.</p>",

These two rooms are part of the original four-roomed cottage completed in 1860. Can you find what kind of light source the Ginn family may have used in the room before electricity? How did they store their food? How would the Ginn family have mended their clothes? Look out for these kinds of items in the other rooms too, as we travel through time and explore the lives of the families who occupied this Cottage for over 100 years.</p>",
