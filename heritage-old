Along with Duntroon House and gardens, Duntroon Dairy, Duntroon Woolshed, St Johns Church Precinct, Mugga Mugga Homestead, and Majura Homestead, the cottage precinct is a significant component of the large pre-Canberra pastoral property now extant as an array of features scattered throughout central Canberra.</p>\n\n<p>The attributes are the entire cottage precinct, comprised of the six room farmhouse and slab outbuilding in their landscaped setting.</p>\n\n<h2>Criterion B: Rarity</h2>\n\n<p>The c1860 Blundell's Farmhouse, Slab Outbuilding and Surrounds remain today as a rare survivor of pastoral activities on the Limestone Plains.
