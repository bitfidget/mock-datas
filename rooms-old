      "description": "<p>William and Mary Ginn and their three children, Walter, Henry and Agnes were the first family to move into the Cottage in about 1860. The Ginns migrated to Australia from England aboard the <i>Alfred</i> in 1857 in search of a better life. William was employed by the Duntroon Estate as the head ploughman and Mary, unlike other wives of workers on the Duntroon Estate, was not employed outside her home. These two rooms are part of the original four-roomed cottage completed in 1860. Can you find what kind of light source the Ginn family may have used in the room before electricity? How did they store their food? How would the Ginn family have mended their clothes? Look out for these kinds of items in the other rooms too, as we travel through time and explore the lives of the families who occupied this Cottage for over 100 years.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Blundells Cottage was occupied as a home for 100 years and has now existed for 160 years, so has been repainted countless times. Some of those layers of paint are visible here. A forensic paint analysis report found that some of the oldest paint is the pale blue. The Blundell family lived in the Cottage before and after Canberra was chosen as Australia's Federal Capital. Imagine the development of the city they would have seen during their decades in the Cottage.</p>",
