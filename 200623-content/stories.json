Most mothers could make clothes for their children, often out of old, larger clothes. A woman's sewing kit was amongst her most prized possessions and usually contained large and small scissors, thread, needles and a thimble. Can you find a sewing kit in every room at Blundells Cottage? Have sewing kits stayed the same or changed over time?</p>",
