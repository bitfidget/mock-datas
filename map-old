Blundells Cottage is the one of the few remaining cottages from that time period. In addition to the provision of lodgings, the Campbells granted workers a free half day on Saturdays to tend their gardens. Subsequent families also grew their own food for themselves and for sale. This garden bed represents the approximate site of Alice Oldfield's garden. In the 1960s, the Sainsbury family grew potatoes and watermelons on the western side of the house.</p>",

When his ship <i>The Sydney</i> was wrecked, he was compensated in the form of rich, grazing land on the Limestone Plains, now Canberra. He built Duntroon House on his large Duntroon Estate in 1830, the first limestone dwelling in the region. By 1860, George Campbell, Robert's son, and his wife Marrianne Campbell had moved into Duntroon House. They started a major building program on the estate which included workman's cottages for the newly arrived immigrant workers from Britain. Blundells Cottage was made from stone quarried from Black Mountain and Mount Ainslie and was based upon crofters cottages of Western Scotland.</p>",
